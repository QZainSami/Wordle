# Wordle Game Project Proposal

## Project Title  
CLI Wordle Game using Data Structures in C++

## Course  
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)  

## Student Level  
3rd Semester, Computer Science  

---

## 1. Introduction  
The project is a **Wordle clone implemented in C++**, designed to reinforce concepts of **data structures, modular programming, and file handling**.  
Wordle is a popular word-guessing game where players guess a secret word within a limited number of attempts.  
After each guess, feedback is given on whether letters are:  
- Correct and in the right position  
- In the word but in the wrong position  
- Not in the word at all  

---

## 2. Objectives  
- Implement the Wordle game using **C++ and DSA concepts** (linked list, arrays).  
- Improve understanding of **arrays, linked lists, and file handling**.  
- Practice **modular code design** with header files and separate class implementations.  
- Provide an engaging CLI interface with features like **hints, best score saving, and colored feedback**.  

---

## 3. Key Features  
- **Dictionary of 60+ words** (stored in arrays).  
- **Random word selection** for replayability.  
- **Linked list** to store and display guess history.  
- **CLI color coding** (green, yellow, gray feedback).  
- **Lives system (hearts ❤️)** showing remaining attempts.  
- **Hints system** (one hint per game).  
- **Best score tracking** stored in a file.  
- **How to Play section** in the menu.  
- **Replay option** after finishing a game.  

---

## 4. Data Structures Used  
- **Array:** To store the dictionary of possible words.  
- **Linked List:** To store the player’s guess history during each game.  
- **File Handling:** To save and load the best score (`bestscore.txt`).  

---

## 5. Tools & Technologies  
- **Language:** C++ (standard library only).  
- **Compiler:** g++ (Linux) / MinGW (Windows).  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code / Code::Blocks / Dev C++.  

---

## 6. Expected Outcomes  
- A functional CLI game with replayability.  
- Demonstrated use of **DSA concepts**.  
- Professional code structure with **header files and separate implementation files**.  
- Engaging project presentation for academic evaluation.  

---

## 7. Future Enhancements  
- Add **difficulty levels** (Easy = 4 letters, Medium = 5, Hard = 6).  
- Extend dictionary with 1000+ words from a file.  
- Implement multiplayer support.  
- Create a GUI version using C++ frameworks (Qt/SDL).
