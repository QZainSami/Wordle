## Project Overview

This is a complete implementation of the popular Wordle game in C++ for the command line interface. The game features:
- Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Color-coded feedback system
- Hint system (one per game)
- Score tracking with best score persistence
- Guess history tracking using linked lists
- Interactive menu system

**Game Rules:**
- Guess a 5-letter word within 6 attempts
- Green = correct letter in correct position
- Yellow = correct letter in wrong position  
- Gray = letter not in the word

## Summary

This Wordle implementation demonstrates several important C++ concepts:

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, encapsulation, constructors/destructors
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, linked lists, dynamic memory allocation
- **File I/O:** Reading/writing persistent data (best scores)
- **Memory Management:** Dynamic allocation, proper cleanup, pointer manipulation
- **Modular Design:** Separation of concerns across multiple files
- **User Interface:** Menu systems, input validation, colored output
- **Algorithm Design:** String matching, feedback generation

The code is well-structured with clear separation between game logic, data management, and user interface components, making it maintainable and extensible.
